//! Capability-oriented random number generators
//!
//! This corresponds to [`rand`].
//!
//! Capability-oriented APIs represent access to external resources as
//! objects which can be passed around between different parts of a
//! program.
//!
//! Two notable features are the [`OsRng`] and [`CapRng`] types, which
//! wrap up access to the operating system entropy source in capability
//! objects.
//!
//! This crate uses the existing `rand::SeedableRng` trait rather than having
//! its own version, however while `rand::SeedableRng` is mostly just a pure
//! interface, it provides a `from_entropy` function which directly reads
//! from the operating system entropy source. To preserve the
//! capability-oriented interface, avoid using `rand::SeedableRng`'s
//! `from_entropy` function on any of the types that implement that trait.
//!
//! [`OsRng`]: crate::rngs::OsRng
//! [`CapRng`]: crate::rngs::CapRng
