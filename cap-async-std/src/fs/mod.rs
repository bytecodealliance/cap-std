//! A capability-oriented filesystem API modeled after `async_std::fs`.
//!
//! This corresponds to [`async_std::fs`].
//!
//! Instead of [`async_std::fs`'s free functions] and [`async_std::fs::File`]'s
//! constructors which operate on bare paths, this crate has methods on [`Dir`]
//! which operate on paths which must be relative to the directory.
//!
//! Where `async_std` says "the filesystem", this API says "a filesystem", as
//! it doesn't assume that there's a single global filesystem namespace.
//!
//! Since all functions which expose raw file descriptors are `unsafe`,
//! I/O handles in this API are unforgeable (unsafe code notwithstanding).
//! This combined with a lack of absolute paths provides a natural
//! capability-oriented interface.
//!
//! This crate uses the existing `async_std::path::Path` rather than having its own
//! path type, however while `async_std::path::Path` is mostly just a pure datatype,
//! it includes aliases for several `async_std::fs` functions. To preserve the
//! capability-oriented interface, avoid using `async_std::path::Path`'s
//! `canonicalize`, `read_link`, `read_dir`, `metadata`, and `symlink_metadata`
//! functions.
