//! A capability-based API modeled after [`std`].
//!
//! This corresponds to [`std`].
//!
//! Capability-based APIs represent access to external resources as values
//! which can be passed around between different parts of a program.
//!
//! Two notable features are the [`Dir`] and [`Pool`] types:
//!  - `Dir` represents an open directory in a filesystem. Instead of opening
//!    files by absolute paths or paths relative to the current working
//!    directory, files are opened via paths relative to a `Dir`. The concepts
//!    of a process-wide "current working directory" and a single global
//!    filesystem namespace are de-emphasized.
//!  - `Pool` represents a set of network addresses. Instead of allowing
//!    applications to request access to any address and then applying
//!    process-wide filtering rules, filtering rules are built into pools which
//!    may be passed through the program.
//!
//! On WASI, use of this library closely reflects the underlying system
//! API, so it avoids compatibility layers.
//!
//! [`Dir`]: fs::Dir
//! [`Pool`]: net::Pool
