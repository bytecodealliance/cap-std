The `cap-std` project is organized around the eponymous [`cap-std`] crate, and
develops libraries to make it easy to write capability-based code, including:

 - [`cap-std`] itself, which provides capability-based versions of `std` APIs
 - [`cap-async-std`], which is to [`async-std`] what `cap-std` is to `std`
 - [`cap-directories`] which provides capability-based access to
   [standard application directories]
 - [`cap-tempfile`], which provides capability-based access to
   [temporary directories]
 - [`cap-fs-ext`], which provides additional filesystem features beyond
   what's available in `std`
 - [`cap-time-ext`], which provides additional time features beyond
   what's available in `std`
 - [`cap-rand`], which provides capability-based access to
   [random number generators]

Cap-std features protection against [CWE-22], "Improper Limitation of a
Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", which is #8 in the
[2021 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses]. It can also be used to
prevent untrusted input from inducing programs to open "/proc/self/mem" on
Linux.

## Capability-based security

Operating systems have a concept of resource handles, or file descriptors, which
are values that can be passed around within and sometimes between programs, and
which represent access to external resources. Programs typically have the
*ambient authority* to request any file or network handle simply by providing
its name or address:

```rust
let file = File::open("/anything/you/want.txt")?;
```

There may be access-control lists, namespaces, firewalls, or virtualization
mechanisms governing which resources can actually be accessed, but those are
typically coarse-grained and configured outside of the application.

Capability-based security seeks to avoid ambient authority, to make sandboxing
finer-grained and composable. To open a file, one needs a [`Dir`], representing
an open directory it's in:

```rust
let file = dir.open("the/thing.txt")?;
```

Attempts to access paths not contained within the directory:

```rust
let hidden = dir.open("../hidden.txt")?;

dir.symlink("/hidden.txt", "misdirection.txt")?;
let secret = dir.open("misdirection.txt")?;
```

return `PermissionDenied` errors.

This allows application logic to configure its own access, without changing the
behavior of the whole host process, setting up a separate host process, or
requiring external configuration.

## How do I obtain a [`Dir`]?

If every resource requires some other resource to obtain, how does one obtain
the first resource?

There currently are three main ways:
 - Use the [`cap-directories`] crate to create `Dir`s for config, cache and
   other data directories.
 - Use the [`cap-tempfile`] crate to create `Dir`s for temporary directories.
 - Use [`Dir::open_ambient_dir`] to open a plain path. This function is not
   sandboxed, and may open any file the host process has access to.

## Examples

There are several examples of cap-std in use:

 - As a sandbox: For a simple yet complete example of cap-std in action, see
   [this port of tide-naive-static-files], a simple static-file Web server, to
   use cap-std to access the static files, where it prevents path resolution
   from following symlinks outside of the designated root directory. [The diff]
   shows the kinds of changes needed to use this API.

 - As a general-purpose `Dir` type for working with directories: The io-streams
   crate [uses `cap-tempdir`] to create temporary directories for unit tests.
   Here, the main benefit of `Dir` is just convenience—`Dir`'s API lets tests
   just say `dir.open(...)` instead of using `open(path.join(...))` or dealing
   with `chdir` and global mutable state. The fact that it also sandboxes the
   unit tests is just a nice side effect.

 - As an application data store: See the [`kv-cli` example] for a simple example
   of a program using `cap-directories` and `cap-std` APIs to store
   application-specific data.

 - And, cap-std is a foundation for the [`WASI`] implementation in [`Wasmtime`],
   providing sandboxing and support for Linux, macOS, Windows, and more.

## What can I use `cap-std` for?

`cap-std` is not a sandbox for untrusted Rust code. Among other things,
untrusted Rust code could use `unsafe` or the unsandboxed APIs in `std::fs`.

`cap-std` allows code to declare its intent and to opt in to protection from
malicious path names. Code which takes a [`Dir`] from which to open files,
rather than taking bare filenames, declares its intent to only open files
underneath that `Dir`. And, `Dir` automatically protects against paths which
might include `..`, symlinks, or absolute paths that might lead outside of that
`Dir`.

`cap-std` also has another role, within WASI, because `cap-std`'s filesystem
APIs closely follow WASI's sandboxing APIs. In WASI, `cap-std` becomes a very
thin layer, thinner than `libstd`'s filesystem APIs because it doesn't need
extra code to handle absolute paths.

## How fast is it?

On Linux 5.6 and newer, `cap-std` uses [`openat2`] to implement `Dir::open`
with a single system call in common cases. Several other operations internally
utilize [`openat2`], [`O_PATH`], and [`/proc/self/fd`] (though only when /proc
is mounted, it's really `procfs`, and there are no mounts on top of it) for
fast path resolution as well.

Otherwise, `cap-std` opens each component of a path individually, in order to
specially handle `..` and symlinks. The algorithm is carefully designed to
minimize system calls, so opening `red/green/blue` performs just 5 system
calls—it opens `red`, `green`, and then `blue`, and closes the handles for `red`
and `green`.

[`/proc/self/fd`]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html

## What about networking?

cap-std also contains a simple capability-based version of `std::net`, with a
[`Pool`] type that represents a pool of network addresses and ports that can be
accessed, which serves an analogous role to [`Dir`]. It's usable for basic use
cases, though it's not yet very sophisticated.

## What is `cap_std::fs_utf8`?

It's an experiment in what an API with UTF-8 filesystem paths (but which still
allow you to access any file with any byte-sequence name) might look like. For
more information on the technique, see the [`arf-strings` package]. To try it,
opt in by enabling the `fs_utf8` feature and using `std::fs_utf8` in place of
`std::fs`.
