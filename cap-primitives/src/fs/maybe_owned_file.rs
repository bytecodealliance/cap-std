/// owned `File` is expensive and fallible, so use this `struct` to hold either
/// one, and implement [`Deref`] to allow them to be handled in a uniform way.
///
/// This is similar to [`Cow`], except without the copy-on-write part ;-).
/// `Cow` requires a `Clone` implementation, which `File` doesn't have, and
/// most users of this type don't need copy-on-write behavior.

/// And, this type has the special `descend_to`, which just does an assignment,
/// but also some useful assertion checks.
